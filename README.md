## About
This is a personal project on frontend API. One of the goal is to provide a streamlined experience and maximise the
effecive usage of screen area (optimised for 1440px x 900px screen). I have noticed that too often one has to scroll
around to access the search bar or filter.

<ul>
    <li>Connected to API using Apollo on POST method. It seems the head does not need to be set manually this time.</li>
